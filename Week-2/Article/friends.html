          Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another, ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.”
          A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same.Friends can help you celebrate good times and provide support during bad times. Friends prevent isolation and loneliness and give you a chance to offer needed companionship, too. Friends can also: 
          Increase your sense of belonging and purpose.
          In the course of a lifetime, a person gets to know many people. Whatever the case, our closest friends become our companions. 
          Even if you may have a large group of friends with you at school or college, you know that you can only trust a selected group of people with whom you have a true friendship.
           A truly priceless jewel is a Best Friend. Only those who are able to understand the significance of this term can fully appreciate its great relevance. Its sacred nature calls for great care as it is treasured and developed over a lengthy period of time.

          <strong> What's True Friendship? </a> </strong>  <br/> 
          If you have a true buddy, they will support you in your success rather than stand in the corner and look on with envy. If you tell this individual everything, including your secrets and weaknesses, 
          they will preserve it to themselve. Since mutual trust is a key component of friendship, the loyalty of a genuine friend is beyond comprehension. 
          The positive deeds we have committed throughout our lives result in a wonderful companion.
When you need them, they will always be there for you. They make you laugh, forget your sadness, and cheer you up when you're down. Despite the fact that you may have kept a sizable group of friends over your time in high school and college, 
you are aware that only a select group of people truly qualify as friends.We make two different kinds of friends-good friends and true friends, sometimes known as best friends-and it goes without saying that they are of different qualities. The people who have the closest bonds of love, caring, and affection is said to be best friends. Our lives become much more enjoyable, meaningful, beautiful, and full of happiness when we have true friends.
